Callback hell refers to a situation in JavaScript programming where multiple asynchronous operations are nested within each other, resulting in complex and hard-to-read code. It occurs when callbacks are used to handle the outcomes of asynchronous tasks, and those tasks depend on each other or need to be executed in a specific order.

function1(function (result1) {
  // Something
  function2(function (result2) {
        // Something
    function3(function (result3) {
        // Something

      function4(function (result4) {
            // Something
        
        function5(function (result5) {
            // Something

        });
      });
    });
  });
});


Here, each function depends on the nested parent function.
